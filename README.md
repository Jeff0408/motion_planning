# Motion Planning

1. main.py contains examples of how to load and display the 7 environments and how to call a motion planner and plot the planned path.  
  
2. planner.py contains my A* algorithm and funtion I used in this algorithm  
  
3. rrt_3d in the file I run rrt algorithm library which provided by professor  
Here is the link of rrt-algorithm library https://github.com/motion-planning/rrt-algorithms  
  
## Requirements
- [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)  
- [Rtree](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Rtree/)  
- [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/) (only needed for plotting)  

To run this py you should download the library first, and set up the dictionary and path,  
To plot successfully, you should modify the plotting py in ..\..\..\src\utilities  
  
## Result
